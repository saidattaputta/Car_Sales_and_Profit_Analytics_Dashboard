# Car Sales & Service Analytics Dashboard

## Overview

This project analyzes car sales and after-sales service (recalls and sentiment) across multiple models and dealers (2018-2019), based on `CarSalesByModelStart-copy.xlsx`. It delivers key insights and business outcomes via Python (data wrangling) and interactive dashboards (Power BI/Tableau), helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

##  Data Description

- **File:** `CarSalesByModelStart-copy.xlsx`
- **Key Sheets:**
  - **CarSales:** Raw sales transactions (Date, Model, Dealer, Quantity, Profit)
  - **Sheet1:** Sum of quantity sold by dealer
  - **Sheet2:** Monthly profit by model
  - **Sheet3:** Annual profit by dealer
  - **Sheet4:** Model-dealer-wise profit

## Process & Tech Stack

### 1. Data Loading & Cleaning
```
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_excel('CarSalesByModelStart-copy.xlsx', sheet_name='CarSales')
data.dropna(inplace=True)
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
```


### 2. Feature Engineering

```
data['YearMonth'] = data['Date'].dt.to_period('M')
```

### 3. Aggregations

Sales by model
```
sales_by_model = data.groupby('Model')['Quantity Sold'].sum()
```

Profit by dealer
```
profit_by_dealer = data.groupby('Dealer ID')['Profit'].sum()
```


### 4. Visualization

- Plots in **matplotlib/Power BI/Tableau**:
  - Monthly Profit & Units Sold
  - Recalls by Model/System
  - Profit by Dealer
  - Sentiment Breakdown
